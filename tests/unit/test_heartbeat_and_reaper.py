"""Build-tree liveness: the heartbeat cvcpkg publishes and the reaper reading it.

Both halves of the 2026-08-04 incident are pinned here.  The deploy workflow's
disk cleanup deleted /tmp/cvcpkg-haiku-image-b6wd0qrn 90 minutes into a build
because its predicate was

    find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'cvcpkg-*' -type d -mmin +60 -exec rm -rf {} +

and ``-maxdepth 1 -type d -mmin`` tests the TOP directory's OWN mtime, which
stops advancing the moment a build tree has created build/ and install/.  The
first test below is that filesystem fact, stated directly, so nobody has to
take it on faith again.
