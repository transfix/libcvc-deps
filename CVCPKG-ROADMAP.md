# cvcpkg Roadmap

> A cross-platform, language-agnostic binary package archive
> for the scientific computing community.

*Last updated: 2026-07-14*

## Project Rename — `libcvc-deps` → `cvcpkg`

The project is being renamed to **`cvcpkg`** in its entirety; the
`libcvc-deps` name is being dropped.  `cvcpkg` — the CLI, the server, the
recipe archive, and the PyPI distribution — becomes the single name for the
project going forward.

- The Python distribution is already published as **`cvcpkg`** (not
  `libcvc-deps`).
- The GitHub repository will be renamed **`transfix/libcvc-deps` →
  `transfix/cvcpkg`** *before* the first PyPI publish (see Phase 1.5).
- Backward compatibility is retained where downstream consumers depend on
  the old name — e.g. the `libcvc-depsConfig.cmake` compatibility wrapper
  stays so existing `find_package(libcvc-deps)` calls keep working.

> **Release ordering:** the PyPI publish is the **final** step of the
> release — it happens only after the rename (project + repo), the trusted
> publisher is configured for the new repo, and the remaining roadmap gaps
> are closed.

## Vision

cvcpkg exists because existing package management systems have failed the
scientific computing community in one or more critical ways: they are bound to
a single language, locked to one operating system, overcomplicated, unreliable,
or unable to guarantee reproducible builds across platforms.

**cvcpkg is different.**  It is:

- **Language-agnostic** — packages are pre-built binaries (C, C++, Fortran,
  and eventually any compiled language).  There is no requirement to adopt a
  particular build system, runtime, or language ecosystem.
- **OS-agnostic** — first-class support for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  Recipes declare platform-specific build logic; the archive serves every
  variant from a single namespace.
- **Simple but robust** — a single CLI (`cvcpkg`) handles building, publishing,
  installing, and verifying packages.  The server is a lightweight FastAPI
  application backed by PostgreSQL.
- **Reproducible** — each cvcpkg *release* pins a curated snapshot of recipes
  at known-good versions, giving downstream projects a stable foundation.
- **Community-extensible** — anyone can contribute recipes via pull request or
  publish packages to the archive through the authenticated API.

---

## Release Model

### Long-Term Support (LTS) Releases

Each **cvcpkg release** (e.g. v1.3.0, v2.0.0) is a curated, tested set of
recipes and the pre-built binary packages they produce.  A release is treated
as an LTS snapshot:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **Recipe lockdown** | All recipes in the release are pinned to specific versions with verified SHA-256 checksums. |
| **Cross-platform matrix** | Every recipe is built and tested on Linux (x86_64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), and Windows (x64). |
| **Stability guarantee** | Packages in a release are immutable — once published, they do not change.  Broken packages are *yanked*, not updated in place. |
| **Downstream reproducibility** | Projects depending on a cvcpkg release can rebuild at any time and get identical binary artifacts. |
| **Security patching** | Critical CVEs can trigger a point release (e.g. v1.3.1) that replaces only the affected package while keeping everything else identical. |

### Live Recipes

Between releases, **updated and new recipes are available live** in the
repository and on the archive server.  This allows:

- Recipe authors to iterate on build scripts before a release freeze.
- Community contributors to submit new recipes that are not yet part of an
  official release.
- Downstream users to opt in to bleeding-edge packages by explicitly
  requesting them (e.g. `cvcpkg install boost@live`).

When the next release is being hardened, live recipes that meet quality
standards are promoted into the release manifest.

### Release Workflow

    D["Develop<br/>(live)"] --> C["Candidate<br/>(freeze)"]
    C --> R["Release<br/>(LTS tag)"]
    R -- "bug fixes / CVE patches" --> D
```

1. **Development phase** — recipes land on `main`, are built by CI, and
   published to the archive as live packages.
2. **Candidate phase** — a release branch is cut, only bug fixes are merged,
   full cross-platform CI matrix runs, community testing is solicited.
3. **Release** — the branch is tagged, all packages are signed, the release
   manifest is published.  The `prod` branch is updated and the production
   server deploys automatically.

### Phase 1.5 — PyPI Release Readiness

**Status: In Progress**

Items required before `pip install cvcpkg` goes live on PyPI.

#### Packaging & Distribution

Ordered — the PyPI publish is the **last** step and happens only after the
rename and the remaining gaps are closed.

- [x] pyproject.toml at repo root with poetry-core backend
- [x] `cvcpkg` and `cvcpkg-server` entry points
- [x] Recipes bundled into wheel via CI publish workflow
      (fixed: the publish workflow's bundle step now creates the target
      dir, fails loudly, and verifies the built wheel contains recipes)
- [x] Build + live-smoke the wheel on Linux/macOS/Windows via a release
      candidate tag (`cvcpkg-v2.0.0rc6`: 129 recipes bundled, all green)
- [x] Verify `cvcpkg --version` and `cvcpkg-server --version` from the
      installed wheel
- [ ] **Rename the project to `cvcpkg`, dropping `libcvc-deps`** (see the
      Project Rename section above)
- [ ] **Rename the GitHub repo `transfix/libcvc-deps` → `transfix/cvcpkg`**
- [ ] **Configure the PyPI trusted publisher** for the renamed repo:
      owner `transfix`, repo `cvcpkg`, workflow `cvcpkg-publish.yml`,
      environment `pypi`.  (The earlier stable publish failed with
      `invalid-publisher` because no matching trusted publisher exists.)
- [ ] Close the remaining roadmap gaps below
- [ ] **Publish v2.0.0 to PyPI — final release step.**  Gated behind the
      `CVCPKG_PUBLISH_TO_PYPI` repo variable so a stable tag does not
      publish until the rename + trusted publisher are in place.

#### Admin CLI Completeness

- [x] `cvcpkg token` — create, list, revoke, approve/deny requests
- [x] `cvcpkg builder` — list, status, run, unregister
- [x] `cvcpkg builds` — submit, submit-dag, list, cancel, pause, resume, follow-dag, monitor
- [x] `cvcpkg server` — stop, status
- [x] `cvcpkg org` — members, add-member, remove-member
- [x] `cvcpkg recipe` — push (sync recipes to server DB)
- [x] `cvcpkg server stats` — server resource + catalog statistics (DB backend, package/org/builder/job/audit counts, storage)
- [x] `cvcpkg server backup` — trigger a server-side database backup from CLI (sqlite/pg_dump/mysqldump)
- [x] `cvcpkg builder logs` — view recent build jobs / tail a job's log without the full monitor
- [x] `cvcpkg doctor` — diagnose the local toolchain (Python, CMake, Ninja, compiler, git) and server reachability

#### Testing & Quality

- [x] 927 unit tests passing
- [x] 16 integration test modules (server, browser UI, build cache, e2e lifecycle, etc.)
- [x] Integration tests for cvc-requirements.yaml install workflow
- [x] Integration tests for dummy recipe build lifecycle
- [x] CMake integration tests (configure, install, downstream find_package)
- [x] E2E live test (Docker Compose + real server + builder + compile consumer)
- [x] Recipe validation via JSON schema in CI
- [x] Source-fallback integration tests (Linux, macOS)
- [ ] Windows CI integration tests
- [x] Automated upgrade/migration test (v1.x → v2.0.0)
      (migration-chain integrity + legacy-lockfile read; live PostgreSQL migration runs in the Docker job)
- [x] Performance benchmarks for install/resolve with large catalogs (resolver regression guard on a 400-component chain)

#### CMake Integration

- [x] `cvcpkgConfig.cmake` — sets CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH + PKG_CONFIG_PATH
- [x] `libcvc-depsConfig.cmake` — backward-compat wrapper
- [x] `cvcpkg-toolchain.cmake` — for `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=` usage
- [x] Activation scripts set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH on `source activate`
- [x] Document CMake integration in README and docs/ (docs/cmake-integration.md)
- [x] `cvcpkg install` writes cvcpkgConfig.cmake into the prefix automatically
      (also a libcvc-deps compat config + version files)

#### Documentation

- [x] README.md (quick start, install, build, publish)
- [x] docs/api-reference.md
- [x] docs/ci-cd-pipeline.md
- [x] docs/deployment-guide.md
- [x] docs/organizations.md
- [x] docs/cmake-integration.md — CMake usage guide for downstream projects
- [x] docs/recipe-authoring.md — how to create new recipes
- [x] docs/pypi-install.md — pip install guide and extras reference
- [x] CHANGELOG.md — release notes for v2.0.0

#### Gap Analysis

The following items were identified as potential gaps before the PyPI
release.  These are the gaps to close **before** the final publish step.

1. ~~**No CHANGELOG.md**~~ — ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` exists; still needs a
   v2.0.0 entry covering the `cvcpkg` tool changes (doctor, admin CLI,
   recipe-bundling fix, NullPool fix, postgresql recipes) and the rename.
2. ~~**No `cvcpkg doctor` command**~~ — ✅ Done.  `cvcpkg doctor` checks
   Python, pip, CMake, Ninja, a C/C++ compiler, git, and (optionally)
   server reachability.
3. ~~**No `cvcpkg init` command**~~ — ✅ `cvcpkg init <name>` scaffolds a
   schema-valid recipe (recipe.yaml + build scripts) for cmake, meson, or
   autotools.
4. ~~**No `cvcpkg upgrade` command**~~ — ✅ `cvcpkg upgrade [components]`
   checks the catalog for newer versions of the installed components and
   re-installs just those, updating the lockfile (`--dry-run` previews).
5. ~~**No offline mode documentation**~~ — ✅ documented in
   docs/pypi-install.md (local catalog + `--local` source builds + cache).
6. **Recipe test coverage** — building and testing every recipe on all
   platforms is builder-fleet work.  `scripts/recipe_coverage.py` now
   reports declared build-matrix coverage per platform and can gate CI
   (`--require linux,macos,windows`); the actual cross-platform builds
   remain a fleet task.
7. ~~**Signature verification not enforced**~~ — ✅ `cvcpkg install
   --require-signatures` now fails on any unsigned or invalidly-signed
   package; `--verify-signatures` verifies when a signature is present.
   (Making enforcement the default remains a future policy decision.)
8. ~~**No dependency version constraints**~~ — ✅ dependencies carry
   version ranges (e.g. `^3.0`, `==1.3.0`) in the recipe/catalog, and the
   resolver enforces them — user + transitive constraints, with
   intersection and conflict rejection (see test_resolver.py).

### Phase 2 — Analytics & Telemetry

**Status: Planned**

Package administrators need visibility into how the archive is being used
to make informed decisions about resource allocation, deprecation, and
support priorities.

#### Download Analytics

- **Per-package download counts** — total, last 7/30/90 days, all time.
- **Per-version breakdown** — which versions are actively consumed vs. stale.
- **Platform distribution** — what fraction of downloads are Linux vs. macOS
  vs. Windows.  This drives build priority decisions.
- **Geographic distribution** — coarse geo-IP bucketing (continent/country)
  for CDN planning.
- **Temporal patterns** — download trends over time, spike detection.

#### Bandwidth Accounting

- **Per-package bandwidth** — total bytes served per package, per version.
- **Aggregate bandwidth** — daily/weekly/monthly totals for capacity planning.
- **Top consumers** — identify heavy-usage patterns (CI farm vs. individual
  developer downloads).

#### Client Telemetry (Opt-In)

- **Client version distribution** — track cvcpkg CLI versions in the wild to
  inform deprecation timelines.
- **Build environment fingerprints** — OS, architecture, compiler, CMake
  version — anonymized and aggregated.  Helps recipe authors understand the
  environments their packages actually run on.
- **Install success/failure rates** — per-package, per-platform.  Surfaces
  broken recipes quickly.
- **Resolution time** — how long dependency resolution takes as the catalog
  grows.

#### Implementation Plan

1. Add a `download_events` table: `(id, package_id, timestamp, client_ip_hash,
   user_agent, platform, arch, cvcpkg_version, bytes_sent)`.
2. Record download events in the `/v1/download` endpoint asynchronously
   (non-blocking to the download itself).
3. Add admin API endpoints:
   - `GET /v1/analytics/downloads` — filterable download counts
   - `GET /v1/analytics/bandwidth` — bandwidth usage summaries
   - `GET /v1/analytics/platforms` — platform distribution
   - `GET /v1/analytics/trends` — time-series data
4. Display analytics on the landing page and admin dashboard.
5. Client-side telemetry: add an opt-in `cvcpkg telemetry` command that sends
   anonymized build environment data on install.  Controlled by
   `CVCPKG_TELEMETRY=1` env var.  Off by default — never phone home without
   explicit consent.

#### Privacy

- IP addresses are salted-hashed, never stored in plain text.
- Client telemetry is strictly opt-in.
- No personal data is collected — only technical environment metadata.
- All analytics are aggregate; no individual user tracking.

### Phase 3 — Admin Dashboard

**Status: Planned**

A web-based administration interface at `/admin` for managing the cvcpkg
archive without CLI access.

#### Features

- **Package management** — browse, search, yank, unyank, delete packages.
  Inspect signatures, checksums, download counts.
- **Token management** — create, revoke, list API tokens.  View token
  usage history.
- **Audit trail viewer** — search and filter the tamper-evident audit log.
  Verify chain integrity from the UI.
- **Analytics dashboard** — real-time charts: download trends, platform
  distribution, bandwidth usage, top packages, geographic distribution.
- **Release management** — create and manage LTS releases.  Promote live
  recipes into release manifests.  Trigger cross-platform CI builds.
- **Health monitoring** — server uptime, database stats, disk usage,
  certificate expiry.
- **User/org management** (future) — manage publisher accounts, organization
  namespaces, permission scopes.

#### Technical Approach

- Server-side rendered HTML with lightweight JS (htmx or Alpine.js) — no
  heavy SPA framework.  Keeps the deployment simple.
- Admin routes protected by admin-role token auth (cookie-based session after
  initial token login).
- Built into the existing FastAPI application as a sub-router — no separate
  service to deploy.

### Phase 4 — Multi-Language & Ecosystem Expansion

**Status: Future**

cvcpkg currently focuses on C/C++ libraries, but the architecture is
deliberately language-agnostic.  Future expansion:

#### Language Support

- **Fortran** — scientific computing staple, many legacy codebases.
- **Rust** — pre-built native libraries with C-compatible ABI.
- **Python C extensions** — pre-compiled wheels for scientific packages that
  are notoriously hard to build (BLAS, LAPACK, HDF5 bindings).
- **Julia artifacts** — native library packages for Julia's Pkg system.

#### Recipe Ecosystem

- **Recipe templates** — `cvcpkg init` generates a recipe from a template
  (CMake, Meson, Autotools, custom).
- **Recipe validation** — `cvcpkg lint` checks recipes for common errors,
  missing fields, insecure patterns.
- **Dependency resolution** — recipes declare build-time and runtime
  dependencies on other cvcpkg packages.  The resolver computes a dependency
  graph and builds packages in the correct order.
- **Build caching** — cache intermediate build artifacts (object files, CMake
  configs) to speed up CI builds.

#### Interoperability

- **CMake `find_package` integration** — `cvcpkg install` generates
  `cvcpkgConfig.cmake` so downstream CMake projects can
  `find_package(cvcpkg)` and then `find_package(Boost)` transparently.
  *(Partially done — config files exist, auto-install into prefix pending.)*
- **pkg-config support** — generate `.pc` files for each installed package.
  *(Partially done — toolchain sets PKG_CONFIG_PATH, recipes generate .pc files.)*
- **Spack compatibility layer** — import/export recipes from Spack specs.
- **Conan compatibility layer** — consume Conan recipes as cvcpkg recipes.
- **vcpkg manifest mode** — read `vcpkg.json` and resolve packages from the
  cvcpkg archive.

### Phase 5 — Federation & Scaling

**Status: Future**

As the archive grows, a single server won't suffice.  Plan for horizontal
scaling and federation:

- **CDN integration** — serve package archives from CloudFlare R2, AWS S3,
  or similar.  The server becomes a metadata/API layer; binaries are served
  from edge locations.
- **Mirror protocol** — institutions can run local mirrors that sync from
  the primary server.  Useful for air-gapped environments and reducing
  bandwidth costs.
- **Federated registries** — multiple independent cvcpkg servers can
  cross-reference packages.  A client can query multiple registries
  with fallback.
- **Sharded storage** — split the archive across multiple storage backends
  by package name hash or category.
- **Read replicas** — PostgreSQL streaming replication for read-heavy
  workloads.

### Phase 6 — Community & Governance

**Status: Partially Done**

- [x] **Organization namespaces** — `@org/package` scoping for institutional
  publishers, with member management CLI and API.
- [ ] **Package ownership model** — maintainers, co-maintainers, transfer
  process.
- **Review workflow** — community recipe PRs go through automated CI +
  manual review before being merged.
- **Quality tiers** — packages rated by test coverage, platform coverage,
  maintainer responsiveness.
- **Advisory database** — track CVEs affecting published packages, automatic
  yank + advisory notification for affected versions.
- **Documentation hosting** — render recipe README.md on the package page.

---

### Phase 7 — Python Ecosystem Integration (Hermetic Python + Native Prefixes)

**Status: Planned**

cvcpkg already ships CPython interpreters as recipes (`python311`/`312`/`313`) that install
`libpython`, the interpreter, and the stdlib into a prefix under `CVC_INSTALL_DIR`. Phase 7
closes the loop: **cvcpkg installs upstream Python wheels *into that same prefix*** so a
downstream project gets one activatable prefix carrying both the native C/C++ libraries
(`find_package`-able) *and* a complete, pinned Python environment (`import`-able) — with minimum
system dependencies. This extends cvcpkg's "any compiled language" vision to the Python packages
layered on top of those libraries, and gives the CVC science stack (volrover, MolSurf, TexMol,
F2Dock) a single reproducible **Python + native** environment.

**Two new `source.type` values (additive, schema_version 1):**

- **`python_wheel`** — stage a pinned, sha256-verified prebuilt wheel (numpy, torch, sionna,
  warp-lang, physicsnemo) via `pip install --no-deps --no-index --prefix $CVC_INSTALL_DIR` into the
  prefix interpreter's own `lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`. The wheel analogue of the `prebuilt`
  C-source type; never re-hosted (fetched from PyPI/`download.pytorch.org` at build time).
- **`python_sdist`** — build a C-extension wheel from a pinned sdist with **build-isolation off**
  so the extension links the prefix's **cvcpkg** C libraries (h5py→cvcpkg `hdf5`, an FFTW/CUDA-
  linking extension→cvcpkg `fftw3`/`cufft`, mpi4py→cvcpkg MPI) via `depends.build` on the cvcpkg C
  recipes + `HDF5_DIR`/`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` env. This is the hermeticity payoff: no `apt install
  libhdf5-dev`; the extension binds cvcpkg's copy.

Recipes add a top-level **`python:`** block (`interpreter`, `abi`, `manylinux_min`,
`build_isolation`, pinned `build_requires`); a "resolve like pip from requirements.txt" mode is
**rejected** for release artifacts — every wheel/sdist is pinned by filename + sha256, transitive
Python deps are themselves cvcpkg Python recipes resolved by the existing `depends` graph.

**Hermeticity goals:** every wheel/sdist sha256-pinned and frozen in the LTS release manifest
alongside the C recipes; offline/air-gapped install via a local mirror (`--no-index`); the only
system requirement is a C toolchain + the manylinux glibc floor. Composes with Phase 1.5
(`pip install cvcpkg`): the tool is pip-installable; the tool then installs other wheels into a
target prefix. Known tension: the `torch` wheel bundles its own CUDA and will not share cvcpkg's —
ship it self-contained as `python_wheel`; reserve cvcpkg CUDA-math recipes for C++ consumers and
`python_sdist` extensions we build.

**Planned CUDA-math recipes (prerequisite for the C++/sdist side).** Prebuilt-staging recipes for
the NVIDIA redistributable math libs (download `.tar.xz`, sha256-verify, generate a relocatable
`Config.cmake`): a `cuda-cudart` base + `cufft`, `cublas`, `cusparse`, `cusolver`. Dep order
`cudart → cublas/cusparse → cusolver`; Linux-first, Windows-optional (NVIDIA ships no macOS/wasm).
Highest cross-value is `cufft` (F2Dock's FFT-correlation docking; `libcufftw` is a near drop-in for
the existing `fftw3` recipe), then `cublas`/`cusolver`/`cusparse` for volrover/MolSurf dense &
sparse solves.

#### Per-Interpreter Wheel Matrix (incl. Free-Threaded / No-GIL)

cvcpkg ships **five** CPython interpreters as recipes — `python311`,
`python312`, `python313`, and `python313t` (built with `--disable-gil`),
plus the `python3` meta-recipe.  The wheel work above is not a single
recipe per package: it is a **matrix** of wheel recipes, one per shipped
interpreter ABI, so any prefix interpreter gets a complete, pinned wheel
set built for *exactly* its ABI tag:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Interpreters["cvcpkg interpreters"]
        P311["python311<br/>(cp311)"]
        P312["python312<br/>(cp312)"]
        P313["python313<br/>(cp313)"]
        P313T["python313t<br/>(cp313t · no-GIL)"]
    end
    subgraph Wheels["wheel recipes (python_wheel / python_sdist)"]
        W["numpy · scipy · h5py · mpi4py · …"]
    end
    P311 --> W
    P312 --> W
    P313 --> W
    P313T --> W
```

- [ ] **Wheel recipes for every shipped interpreter** — each wheel package
      gets variants for cp311 / cp312 / cp313 / cp313t, resolved through the
      normal `depends` graph against the matching `python31x` recipe.
- [ ] **Free-threaded (no-GIL) wheel channel** — the `python313t` (cp313t)
      column is the flagship: every cp313t wheel is built against the
      free-threaded interpreter **and its test suite is executed with the
      GIL disabled on the builder fleet** as part of the recipe `test:`
      step.  cvcpkg can therefore deliver packages that **provably work
      without the GIL** — not "should work", but *demonstrated on every
      platform we publish for*, which general-purpose indexes cannot claim.
- [ ] **Per-interpreter test harness** — a shared `_common` helper that
      imports the package and runs its smoke/test suite under the exact
      target interpreter (GIL-disabled run for cp313t), failing the build on
      thread-safety regressions (`PYTHON_GIL=0`, `-X gil=0`).
- [ ] **Release-manifest freeze** — the LTS manifest pins the full
      interpreter × wheel matrix (filenames + sha256) alongside the C
      recipes, so a release describes one reproducible Python stack per
      interpreter.

---

### Phase 8 — Self-Hosting & Universal Bootstrap (`cvpkg`)

**Status: Planned**

Close the loop on distribution: cvcpkg should be installable *by* cvcpkg,
and bootstrappable on a bare machine with **zero prerequisites** — no
Python, no compiler, no package manager.

#### cvcpkg self-install recipe

- [ ] **A `cvcpkg` recipe** that installs the cvcpkg wheel into a prefix
      using cvcpkg's own Python packages: `depends` on a shipped
      interpreter (`python313` by default) plus `python_wheel` recipes for
      the runtime deps (click, httpx, PyYAML, cryptography, …).
      `cvcpkg install cvcpkg` then produces a self-contained, activatable
      prefix whose `bin/cvcpkg` runs on the prefix interpreter — fully
      hermetic, no system Python involved.
- [ ] Dogfoods the Phase 7 machinery end-to-end (interpreter recipe +
      wheel matrix + entry-point shims) and becomes the recommended
      install path for build machines.

#### `cvpkg` — an Actually Portable Executable bootstrap

- [ ] **APE build toolchain** — use `cosmocc` (already a cvcpkg recipe and
      cross-platform target) with CPython to compile a Python application
      into a single **Actually Portable Executable** (αcτµαlly pδrταblε
      εxεcµταblε) that runs unmodified on Linux, macOS, Windows, and the
      BSDs.
- [ ] **`cvpkg` recipe** — a trimmed cut of cvcpkg (install / verify /
      activate / doctor; no server, no builder) compiled as a completely
      self-contained APE.  One binary, every supported platform, no
      installed Python required.
- [ ] **Zero-dependency bootstrap** — publish the APE on cvcpkg.org so a
      bare machine can go from nothing to a working build environment:

      ```
      curl -LO https://cvcpkg.org/cvpkg && chmod +x cvpkg
      ./cvpkg install --prefix ./deps boost hdf5 fftw3
      ```

- [ ] **Fleet smoke test** — CI builds the APE via the cosmocc recipe
      infrastructure and executes it on every builder platform in the
      fleet (linux, windows, macos, freebsd, netbsd, openbsd) each release.

### Phase 9 — Fleet & Platform Expansion

**Status: Planned**

- [ ] **GhostBSD builders** — GhostBSD is FreeBSD-based (binary-compatible
      userland, `pkg` packages), so a builder validates the desktop-BSD
      story cheaply.  Decide whether GhostBSD consumes the existing
      `freebsd` platform packages (compat mode) or warrants a distinct
      `ghostbsd` platform tag; provision as an Incus VM on the star
      cluster alongside the existing BSD fleet (see the vm-provisioning
      repo, `docs/CVCPKG-BUILDERS.md`, for capacity notes and the
      provisioning plan).
- [ ] **DragonflyBSD builders** — a genuinely new platform (`dragonflybsd`
      tag): its own kernel, HAMMER2 filesystem, DPorts/`pkg` packages.
      Requires porting the `_common` build helpers and platform detection,
      then an Incus VM pair like the other BSDs.
- [ ] **qemu recipe stack** (see Planned Recipes below) — beyond its value
      as a package, qemu unlocks **emulated builders** for platforms and
      architectures we lack hardware for (arm64/riscv64 Linux, exotic
      BSDs), and reproducible VM images for builder provisioning.
- [ ] **Emulated-arch pilot** — once qemu recipes land, trial a
      qemu-system-aarch64 Linux builder VM to extend the fleet beyond
      x86_64 without new hardware.

### Planned Recipes

| Category | Recipes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Emulation / Virtualization** | qemu, dtc (device-tree compiler), libslirp, capstone | qemu itself as a package, plus emulated builders (Phase 9). Most of qemu's dependency stack already exists as recipes: glib, pixman, zlib, curl, libffi, meson/ninja. |
| **Python wheels (Phase 7)** | numpy, scipy, h5py, mpi4py, … × {cp311, cp312, cp313, cp313t} | per-interpreter wheel matrix; the cp313t column ships provably no-GIL-safe packages. |
| **Bootstrap (Phase 8)** | cvcpkg (self-install), cvpkg (APE) | cvcpkg installable by cvcpkg; single-binary zero-dependency bootstrap. |

### Recipe Categories

Recipes are organized into functional categories to make the archive
browsable and to help users discover related packages:

- **Core** — fundamental libraries (Boost, abseil, logging, threading)
- **Math** — numerical computing (BLAS, LAPACK, FFT, optimization)
- **Imaging** — image codecs and manipulation (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, ImageMagick)
- **Data** — serialization and data formats (HDF5, Protocol Buffers, YAML)
- **Compression** — archive and compression (zlib, zstd, xz, lz4, bzip2)
- **Network** — networking and RPC (gRPC, c-ares, OpenSSL, curl)
- **Geometry** — computational geometry (CGAL, vcglib)
- **Visualization** — 3D rendering and visualization (VTK)
- **GUI / Graphics** — graphical user interface frameworks (Qt6, GTK4, Slint, Skia)
- **Audio** — audio/video processing (FFmpeg, GStreamer, PipeWire)
- **Build tools** — compilers and build systems (CMake, Meson, Ninja, Autotools)
- **Python** — Python interpreters (3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- **Databases** — database clients and embedded databases (MariaDB, SQLite)
- **Runtime / Interop** — FFI, WASM runtimes, text/encoding utilities
- **Security** — CA certificates, TLS

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity over cleverness.**  A graduate student should be able to
   understand the system in an afternoon.  One CLI, one server, one database.

2. **Reproducibility is non-negotiable.**  If a build worked yesterday, it
   must work next year.  Pinned versions, checksums, signed packages.

3. **Cross-platform is a first-class citizen.**  Not an afterthought.  Every
   recipe must build on Linux, macOS, and Windows or clearly document
   platform restrictions.

4. **No vendor lock-in.**  The archive runs on commodity hardware with open
   source software.  The protocol is HTTP + JSON.  Any client can
   interoperate.

5. **Security by default.**  TLS everywhere, signed packages, tamper-evident
   audit trail, role-based access control.  But also: no unnecessary
   complexity.  HMAC-SHA256 tokens are simpler than OAuth and sufficient for
   the threat model.

6. **Community-first.**  The system should be easy to contribute to.  Recipe
   format is YAML — no DSL to learn.  Publishing is a single CLI command.

7. **Data-driven decisions.**  Analytics and telemetry (always opt-in) help
   administrators prioritize effort where it matters most.

## Naming & Repo Identity

The project has been restructured for the **cvcpkg** identity:

- [x] `cvcpkg` CLI entry point and Python package name
- [x] pyproject.toml at repo root (promoted from tools/cvcpkg/)
- [x] `cvcpkgConfig.cmake` installed alongside backward-compat `libcvc-depsConfig.cmake`
- [x] README.md and docs reflect cvcpkg branding
- [ ] **Repo rename** — `transfix/libcvc-deps` → `transfix/cvcpkg` (deferred
  until PyPI release to avoid breaking CI in downstream repos; GitHub will
  redirect git URLs but `uses:` directives in libcvc and TexMol workflows
  must be updated simultaneously)
- [ ] **PyPI publication** — `pip install cvcpkg` (pending final QA)

---

## Contributing

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/transfix/libcvc-deps) for:

- Recipe authoring guide (see `recipes/zlib/` as a reference template)
- Server development setup (`pip install -e ".[production]"`)
- CI/CD pipeline documentation (`docs/ci-cd-pipeline.md`)
- Pull request process (squash-merge via admin review)

Quick start for recipe contributors:

```bash
pip install -e .
cvcpkg validate                     # validate all recipes
cvcpkg build zlib --prefix ./prefix # build a single recipe
cvcpkg pack zlib --output-dir dist  # build + archive
```

**Documentation convention — diagrams are Mermaid.**  Charts, graphs, and
architecture diagrams in project docs use fenced ```mermaid blocks (GitHub
renders them natively) rather than ASCII art.  When editing a document that
still contains an ASCII diagram, convert it to Mermaid as part of the change.

*This is a living document.  It will be updated as the project evolves.*
