"""Liveness heartbeat for build scratch trees, so reapers can spare them.

Builders share ``/tmp`` with a disk reaper (``scripts/reap-stale-build-dirs.sh``,
run from the deploy workflow) whose whole job is to delete leaked build trees
before a host fills its disk.  Telling a *leaked* tree from an *in-flight* one
from the outside is the hard part, and the obvious test is wrong:

    find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name 'cvcpkg-*' -type d -mmin +60 -exec rm -rf {} +

``-maxdepth 1 -type d -mmin`` tests the **top directory's own mtime**, and a
directory's mtime only advances when an entry is added or removed *directly*
inside it.  A build tree creates ``build/`` and ``install/`` in its first
second and then writes tens of thousands of files several levels down, so the
top directory's mtime freezes almost immediately and the tree looks stale after
an hour no matter how hard it is working.  On 2026-08-04 that deleted
``/tmp/cvcpkg-haiku-image-b6wd0qrn`` 90 minutes into a build, orphaning six
processes onto a deleted image file.  Raising the threshold only moves the
cliff: ``llvm18`` declares ``timeout_seconds: 18000`` (5 hours).

The fix is for the owner of the tree to publish liveness, and the channel has
to survive the constraint that **the reaper may be a different user**.  Scratch
roots come from :func:`tempfile.mkdtemp`, which creates them ``0700``, so a
non-root reaper cannot open — cannot even ``stat`` — anything *inside* the
tree.  It can always ``stat`` the root itself, because ``/tmp`` is ``1777``.

So the load-bearing signal is deliberately the crudest one available:

1. **The root directory's own mtime**, refreshed by :func:`os.utime` on every
   beat.  Needs no new protocol, no read permission, no parsing; it makes the
   *existing* ``-mmin`` predicate correct instead of replacing it.  This is the
   signal the reaper relies on.
2. **A ``.cvcpkg-heartbeat`` file** in the root recording pid / comm / host /
   boot id / label / start time.  Readable only by the owner or root — which
   covers every reaper we actually run — and it is what turns "something was
   deleted" into "``haiku-image``, pid 21114, started 09:15, still running".
   It also lets a reaper spare a tree whose heartbeat *thread* wedged but whose
   process is demonstrably alive, and (the other direction) reclaim a tree
   immediately once the recorded pid is gone.

One background thread serves every watched root, not one per build: the
builder daemon runs thousands of jobs in a single long-lived process, and a
thread per job would be an unbounded leak.  Roots that have been deleted drop
themselves from the watch set, so a caller that never unwatches leaks nothing.

Everything here is best-effort: a heartbeat failure must never fail a build, so
every operation swallows its errors.  A tree with no heartbeat at all (an older
cvcpkg, a foreign ``cvcpkg-*`` directory) still gets reaped by the script's
fallback, which walks for the newest mtime anywhere in the tree rather than
trusting the root.
