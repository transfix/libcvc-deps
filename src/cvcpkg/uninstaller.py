"""Remove installed bundles from a prefix (the inverse of installer.py).

An installed prefix keeps no per-package file record: extraction is a blind
merge, and the ``share/libcvc-deps/manifest.yaml`` each bundle carries is
clobbered by whichever bundle extracted last.  Until Phase 15's per-prefix
state database lands, the ground truth for "which files does package X own"
is X's *archive*: the lockfile records every bundle's sha256 + archive_url,
the download cache is content-addressed, and an archive's member list is
exactly what extraction materialized into the prefix.

Three consequences shape this module:

- A bundle built from source (``source-build`` in the lockfile) has no
  archive, hence no file list — it cannot be uninstalled file-by-file.
- Dependency edges come from each archive's embedded manifest, falling back
  to a local recipe's ``depends.runtime`` when no archive is cached.
- A path may be shipped by several bundles (extraction is last-writer-wins),
  so removal must skip paths a surviving package also owns, and the
  ``share/libcvc-deps/`` metadata slot — which *every* bundle writes — may
  only be deleted when no package survives.
