"""Principal storage — turning an IdP subject into a durable cvcpkg identity.

The whole difficulty here is one column.  ``principals.name`` is not a display
string: organization membership is keyed on a bare name
(``org_members.token_name``), compared with ``==``, with no check that the
named token still exists or is still live.  So allotting a name is granting
whatever authority that name already carries.

Two consequences drive this module:

* **Resolution is on ``(issuer, subject)``, never email.** ``tokens.email`` is
  unvalidated free text, self-settable via ``PATCH /v1/tokens/{name}/email``,
  carries no unique constraint, and is readable through an endpoint that
  documents itself as requiring no authentication.  Matching on it would let
  whoever types an address first inherit the account.
* **The taken-set includes revoked tokens.**  ``uq_tokens_active_name`` is a
  *partial* index and ``revoke()`` sets one boolean without touching
  ``org_members``.  A revoked token named ``joe`` still owns every membership
  row it ever had, so handing ``joe`` to a new principal would hand over those
  orgs.  Checking only live names is the hole this closes.
