"""Builder disk reclamation — orphaned job scratch dirs and the download cache.

A build job runs inside a per-job root (``cvcpkg-job-<recipe>-<rand>/``) in the
builder's work dir, and ``_execute_job`` removes that tree in a ``finally``.
That covers every path the job *returns* through — but not the one that
actually leaks: when the builder process is **killed mid-job** (a deploy
restart, SIGKILL from the recovery runbook, OOM, host reboot) the ``finally``
never runs and the tree is stranded. The leak is therefore proportional to how
often builders are restarted, which is "every deploy", and it accumulates
silently until a build dies with ENOSPC (dev cluster, 2026-08-02: 28 GiB of
stranded job dirs, 96% full, three CUDA jobs failed).

Two sweeps, deliberately different:

* **Startup** (``max_age_seconds=0``) — every job dir present when a builder
  starts is by definition an orphan: the single-instance pidfile guard means no
  other builder shares this work dir, and this process owns nothing yet. So the
  startup sweep needs no age heuristic and reclaims everything immediately.
* **Periodic** — a long-lived builder that has not restarted still wants a
  safety net (a wedged job thread that never reached its ``finally``). This one
  IS age-gated and takes the in-flight job roots as *keep*, so it can never
  delete a live build of its own.

"Age" here is deliberately not the top directory's mtime, which is the trap the
``/tmp`` reaper fell into (see :mod:`cvcpkg.heartbeat`): a directory's mtime
only advances when an entry is added or removed *directly* inside it, so a
build tree looks stale within seconds of creating ``build/`` and ``install/``.
:func:`_is_active` asks the heartbeat, the owning pid and the newest mtime
*anywhere* in the tree instead — the same ladder, in the same order, as
``scripts/reap-stale-build-dirs.sh``, so an in-process sweep and an
out-of-process one can never disagree about what is live.

The download cache (``~/.cache/cvcpkg/<sha256>/``) is content-addressed, so
pruning it is always safe — the only cost of over-pruning is re-downloading.
It is swept by age, and defaults are conservative for that reason.
