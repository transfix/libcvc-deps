# to CMAKE_MODULE_PATH when you build via its toolchain file / qt-cmake.
# In this plain find_package(Qt6) build it isn't on the path, so
# find_package(PlatformGraphics) errors and both backend plugins get
# skipped (leaving qtmultimedia without any media backend).  Seed the
# platforms dir so the (soft) EGL lookup resolves and the plugins build.

# Backend selection: Qt 6.8 gates its FFmpeg media backend on a low-level
# audio backend — on Linux that means PulseAudio (QT_FEATURE_pulseaudio),
# which we now provide via the libpulse recipe.  With libpulse present Qt
# auto-enables BOTH the FFmpeg and GStreamer backends, so we let feature
# auto-detection decide rather than forcing anything.
